                </div>
                <p>Pixels have long been a signature design element in Hyundai vehicles, but I saw an opportunity to expand their role beyond decoration and transform them into a defining element of Hyundai’s design DNA. Drawing inspiration from traditional Hanok windows and the pioneering work of Nam June Paik, who is considered the “father” of video art, I was inspired by how Korean design fosters innovation within structured constraints—allowing radical ideas to emerge within the framework of a literal cube. I wanted to apply this thinking to pixels, evolving them from a static graphic motif into a dynamic, functional asset for the N series.</p>

                <div class="text-columns">
                    <p>Initially, I explored how pixels could reshape the vehicle’s character, emphasising either triangular or rectangular elements to toggle between a daily and a sporty aesthetic. However, I soon shifted my focus to a deeper challenge relevant to the N series, which was, “How can we offset the heavy battery weight of high-performance EVs without compromising aesthetics while leveraging the unique structural opportunities of EVs to redefine the N experience?”</p>
                    <p>This led to the creation of the “N Pixel”, which is a proposal for pixels to move beyond their current role as a decoration to play an active role in shaping performance and perception in the future N series. Instead of simply emitting artificial light, pixels are reimagined as light-refracting glass artefacts embedded with liquid crystals into the car’s glazing. By applying voltage, N pixels create controlled optical distortions, such as magnification and reduction. By manipulating light rather than physical mass, N Pixels support N's high performance by offsetting its heavy battery weight while creating a new visual vocabulary for the N series and offer an advanced in-cabin experience by visually enhancing the sense of speed and motion.</p>

                <p>For the exterior, the goal was to develop an ultra-lightweight, reduced body that supports high performance, with N Pixels shaping its appearance. After studying aerodynamic forms, I arrived at a cab-forward design that dramatically reduces weight by eliminating the rear area. This approach leverages the advantages of EV architecture, shifting the passenger space forward and optimising aerodynamics via a teardrop-shaped roofline.</p>

                <p>Here, N pixels serve as a structural element that lends the car body visual interest by applying optical distortion to shape its appearance and achieve a sporty yet minimalist form language, which is inspired by the “light architectural” aesthetic of Hanok. Here is a demonstration of how N Pixels can transform a purely functional EV body into an iconic Hyundai N vehicle of the future, where they serve two key purposes:</p>
                <div class="text-columns">
                    <p>1. Visually reconstructing the rear area: Since a teardrop-shaped rear can visually slow the car down, controlled optical distortions counteract this effect by "filling in" the missing rear to make the car appear larger and more dynamic than its actual proportions suggest.</p>
                    <p>2. Enhancing the minimalistic aesthetic: Selective transparency in areas like the front creates a minimalistic, futuristic look.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The result is a visually striking form, where N Pixels create parallel, forward-leaning vertical lines with symmetric light reflections, reinforcing a form language of speed and motion. By magnifying and reducing vehicle areas in intended ways, N Pixels reshape proportions in ways that defy physical limitations. The takeaway is that we can use optical manipulation rather than physical mass to define the vehicle’s identity and transform an aerodynamic object into a bold, recognisable Hyundai N vehicle without adding significant weight—only lightweight glass structures (N Pixels).</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">New Way of Seeing</h2>

                    <img src="images/hyundai-n-pixel-20.jpg" alt="Hyundai N Pixel">
                </div>
                <p>In the era of autonomous driving, we no longer have to see things the way they are. The interior, utilising N Pixels, challenges conventional design by offering radically new ways to experience speed through optical illusion. Inspired by Hanok’s Maru, an outdoor raised platform for relaxation, the interior is envisioned as an open, floor-like space, where caved-in seating allows us to recline barefoot, sensitising our perception. In this state, a fisheye effect appears directly in our field of vision, distorting the environment and amplifying the sense of speed beyond the car’s actual speed.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <div class="video-wrapper">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Beyond speed perception, N Pixels dissolve the boundary between interior and exterior. By refracting in-cabin lighting, they create immersive experiences and deepen our connection with the surrounding environment. N Pixels convert organic, flowing light into structured, geometric lighting patterns, reinforcing the bold, technical identity of the N series. For this proposal, AI-generated patterns inspired by Korean letterforms influenced the lighting sequences—bridging Hyundai’s heritage with the future of immersive driving experiences.</p>

                <p>With N Pixel, I aimed to evolve Hyundai’s design language for the N series, transforming pixels from a static decorative element into an active structural element. By leveraging natural light and optical illusions, N Pixel achieves radical transformation in both exterior aesthetics and performance while redefining interior perception. Rooted in Korean design philosophy, it follows the principle of innovation within elegant constraints—maximizing impact without unnecessary complexity. Advancing Hyundai’s heritage in the context of Korean design philosophy, the concept “N Pixel” redefines how we interact with speed, space, and the driving environment for the next generation of the N series.</p>
