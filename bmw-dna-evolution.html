                <p>Today, cars are static machines. There is general lack of personalisation, and despite undergoing ever-changing circumstances in our lifetime, cars cannot dynamically adapt to and optimise for evolving performance needs, resulting in a one-size-fits-all experience. Defining this problem led to the question: What if you could experience a car that is not just a machine but a living companion that grows with you over time? This is the main idea behind BMW DNA Evolution, a concept inspired by biological processes, where the goal was to create a hyper-personalised driving experence leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to run a system that empowers the car to come alive, continuously learn about and adapt in real-time to your personal “DNA”—your current needs, habits, preferences and lifestyle as a driver.</p>
                <p>This concept is based on the idea that BMW has core values which their cars have embodied over the last century. After research, I defined these as premium quality, performance and innovation. These could be called their DNA, and it was always BMW’s job to reinterpret this DNA for every new release. What if, with the help of AI, drivers can participate in this reinterpretation, and define what BMW DNA means for them personally?</p>
                <p>I broke down the BMW DNA further into its various aspects or “genes” that can be turned on or off depending on how relevant they are for the driver at any given moment. This unique gene combination gives rise to the driver’s own BMW DNA.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">DRIVER, AI, NEURONS AND MODULES: A Living Ecosystem</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-3.jpg" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                </div>
                <div class="text-columns">
                    <p>This concept is about allowing the car to grow and optimise its form based on the driver’s BMW DNA. The expression of the BMW DNA and the corresponding growth process is driven by a system, BMW CORPUS, which facilitates interactions between the driver, emotional GenAI, neurons and smart modules. AI serves as the car’s brain, using neurons (electrical channels), to communicate with modules (shape-shifting components of the car body), deriving their form and functionality from communicating with AI. In the following, I cover the relationship between these elements in detail.</p>
                    <p>When it came to designing this system, I was inspired by the connection between AI and the human brain, where both serve as the central intelligence of the whole system which coordinates input (ow, burning heat on fingers!) and output (fingers swell) using the nervous system to carry information fingers-to-brain and brain-to-fingers.</p>
                </div>
            <h2 class="section-title">DRIVER <-> AI: Like a Raising a Child</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-4.gif" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                </div>
                <p>The role of AI is to behave like a curious child eager to learn about its “parent” (the driver) and environment as a dynamic learning entity, where it gathers data on your needs, habits, emotions, and preferences in order to continuously update your BMW DNA through AI-driven learning technologies such as emotional AI, speech recognition, and computer vision. The driver accompanies the growth process by providing guidance and feedback. This relationship between the driver and AI involves three main phases:</p>
                <p>1. Birth phase: AI starts by analysing the driver and activates relevant genes, which marks the birth of your BMW DNA.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-5.gif" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                </div>
                <p>2. Growth phase: AI gathers input data from the driver using emotional AI and speech recognition, and the environment using computer vision. It uses this data to drive growth, which is specified next in AI <-> MODULES. The choice of these technologies is made from the research that… 1) Emotional AI can analyse facial expressions, voice tone, and physiological signals (like heart rate) to infer the driver’s emotional state, which is useful for collecting implicit data about satisfaction with the car’s performance. 2) Speech recognition allows for hands-free interaction between the driver and AI to capture verbal feedback and observations from the driver, which is useful for collecting explicit data. 3) Computer vision is useful for capturing visual data in the environment as inspiration for generating outputs.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-6.jpg" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                </div>
                <p>3. Recording phase: AI saves all acquired data from every drive into a tangible database as its “brain” designed like a tree-ring that grows over time, allowing for storage and sharing of experiences in form of data, fostering a community where drivers can benefit from each other’s experiences, enhancing the collective intelligence of the system. You could “play” archives to experience others’ daily life, holidays, or useful forms developed over time to support those with special needs.</p>
                <div class="image-container" style="position: relative;">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-7.jpg" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                    <div id="sketch-holder" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: -10%; mix-blend-mode: overlay;"></div>
                </div>

                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-8.jpg" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                </div>
                <p>How exactly does AI create an evolving car, continuously changing its form and functionality? The car body is made of shape-shifting modules that are connected to AI through electrical channels or “neurons.” Just like in the human body, these 3 types of neurons allow the AI to use the modules to observe the outside world (retinal), instruct the modules to transform (motor) and finally, receive external stimuli as feedback (sensory).</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-9.gif" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">

                </div>
                <p>To translate the driver’s DNA into a form, AI takes inspiration from the outside world. AI deconstructs these observations into actionable data and develops many inspired guidelines that instruct the modules to transform into corresponding variants, which are transmitted via neurons to the modules. The modules reorganise their structure and deploy into a form to be tested, changing the car’s form and function in real time. With test outcomes from the modules and user feedback, AI determines how successful the form was. The variants either retract into their original form for rebuilding or survive if successful.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-13.jpg" alt="BMW DNA Evolution">
                </div>
                <p>Here, modules undergo ENDLESS CYCLES OF EXPERIMENTATION, TESTING AND OPTIMISATION where AI continuously generates multiple design variants, tests and evaluates their performance, implements them, and learns from both successes and failures. This model mirrors natural evolution, where AI is given the freedom to explore playfully, understanding that multiple iterations lead to optimal outcomes over time, like the double diamond design process. This flexibility is crucial to driving innovation in the car’s form and function. By using AI-DRIVEN ADAPTATION TECHNOLOGIES like 3D generative AI to produce variants and evolutionary algorithms to test and optimise outputs, we equip AI with the ability to imitate evolution. This leads to an ENHANCED USER SATISFACTION by providing a deeply personalised driving experience tailored to the driver’s BMW DNA.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Meet Alex: A student with a tight budget looking to save money on fuel. AI knows Alex wants a fuel-efficient ride, so it activates the “aerodynamics” gene. But how does it make this happen? Using computer vision, it searches the environment for aerodynamic inspirations. AI looks around—what’s aerodynamic? Birds! It deconstructs the bird’s shape, learns from it, and reconstructs it into a variety of impressions.</p>

                </div>
                <p>AI combines them in different ways to create variant guidelines that define the texture, structure and behaviour of the variants, which are then projected onto the modules to create them in real life. AI tests and evaluates hundreds of them, each one tested against criteria like air resistance and driver feedback and scored from 0 to 1. Some designs are successful; others are discarded: AI experiments with elements like bird-like bionic flaps or airy bones, which is mostly producing mediocre results. AI is disappointed and consults Alex.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-21.jpg"></img>

                </div>
                <p>Feedback comes in from Alex: “Maybe try something like planes? AI listens, finds a plane, and creates a guideline combined with the highest scoring one from the bird, leading to a sleek, aerodynamic design that helps Alex save money on every trip. This example demonstrates emotional GenAI’s "generative" capacity of conducting trial-and-error experiments to create, identify and refine potential designs that satisfy the driver’s needs.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Persona 2: Mia</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-24.jpg"></img>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-25.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>Meet Mia: A driver who is afraid of driving. The activated genes are “safety” and “driver assistance.” For this example, I was inspired by my mother who dislikes driving, especially on highways, because of the times she almost got involved in car accidents.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-26.jpg"></img>

                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-28.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>Based on this, AI initially searches for and implements sturdy structures like buildings to be able to protect Mia from even a nuclear bomb. However, it soon learns that her fear is psychological, not just physical. AI then searches for human elements that make the driver happy, generating impressions from dogs, children playing with bubbles, soft textiles and a couple holding hands, to design a car that provides emotional support.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/bmw-dna-evolution-29.gif"></img>

                    </video>
                </div>
                <p>For the exterior, AI considers the fact that Mia is not only concerned about her own safety, but also that of others, to produce a balloon-like, self-healing surface materiality that reduces damage in a crash.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>

                    </video>
                </div>
                <p>For the interior, AI mimics human-to-human contact to create a reassuring environment. After obtaining more contact surface with Mia’s arm, AI retrieves biometric data to better understand her emotional state. All of this data that was generated by experimenting together with AI could be shared with the community to help others better cope with the same issue. This example demonstrates emotional GenAI’s “emotional” capacity to adapt not just to functional needs but to emotional ones as well.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Explorative Suggestions</h2>

                <div class="text-columns">
                    <p>By integrating AI-driven learning technologies like emotional AI, speech recognition, and computer vision, we were able to humanise AI as a highly logically and emotionally intelligent companion that we can love hanging around with. However, when it comes to AI-driven adaptation technologies like 3D generative AI and evolutionary algorithms, there is significant progress to be made. Evolutionary algorithms show great potential for mimicking natural evolution. They are already being successfully applied in engineering fields like aerodynamics and structural design, where they optimise complex systems by exploring a broad range of design options and identifying the most efficient solutions.</p>
                    <p>In addition, recent breakthroughs in smart materials, such as self-healing polymers, shape-memory alloys, and 4D-printed structures, open up new possibilities. These materials, capable of changing their form, structure, and behaviour in unique ways, present an exciting opportunity for developing shape-shifting materials that can bring the outputs of generative AI into 3D, moving beyond the limitations of our flat screens. This advancement would allow generative AI to directly create and influence tangible structures in real time.</p>

                </div>
                <p>To wrap it up, this concept is about utilising AI to realise the potential of personalisation while humanising the entire experience, where AI is designed to behave like a child who is not perfect from the beginning, but rather grows up together with the driver as its main consultant through guided experiences that accumulate each drive, reflected in the transformation of its own body. Fueled by playful twists on real-life biological concepts, this concept creates a playground for wilder imaginations: How about an electric car that grows wind turbines on its roof?</p>
                <p>By asking ourselves, “What if cars could evolve?” we open up a future of hyper-personalised mobility where cars are redefined as living companions that learn, adapt, grow, and thrive with their drivers, where every drive becomes a journey of discovery and growth, calling for a reimagining of the relationship between humans and machines.</p>
